FIRST STEP
=========

A request is sent to profile update
 This is what the url will look like
    http://localhost:8080/profile/userid8437922903874
    
When there is userid in the incoming request(url)
    based on that user id
        our backend will make a query to the database and load that user information (name, email, etc)
            then we will add that information to the request object
